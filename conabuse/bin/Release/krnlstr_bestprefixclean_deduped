*********** Verifier Detected a Code Integrity Issue ************\n
The caller provided the IRP Status Information field with a value that\nis greater than the output section of the system buffer.  
The driver is reinitializing an IRP that is still in use. 
The driver is reinitializing an IRP that was created with\nIoMakeAssociatedIrp,\nIoBuildAsynchronousFsdRequest,\nIoBuildSynchronousFsdRequest, or\nIoBuildDeviceIoControlRequest. 
The driver is completing an IRP_MJ_PNP.IRP_MN_REMOVE_DEVICE\nrequest with a failure status code.    
The driver issued an I/O request with an event that was already signalled\nand received a STATUS_PENDING response.  This can result in unwinding\nbefore the I/O is complete.     
A driver has forwarded an IRP at IRQL > DISPATCH_LEVEL.   
A driver has forwarded an IRP at IRQL >= APC_LEVEL.\nThe I/O Completion APC routine will not be able to run for this IRP.   
A driver has passed an invalid device object to a function that requires\na PDO.  
Driver has returned a suspicious status. This is probably due to an\nuninitialized variable bug in the driver.  
A driver has mistakenly called a file I/O function at an IRQL other\nthan PASSIVE_LEVEL.
A driver has succeeded IRP_MJ_PNP.IRP_MN_QUERY_DEVICE_RELATIONS(TargetRelations)\nbut didn't properly fill out the request or forward the IRP to the\nunderlying hardware stack.  
A driver has added a device object that is not a PDO to a device\nrelations query.
A driver has enumerated two child PDO's that returned identical Device\nID's.     
A driver has detached it's device object during a surprise remove IRP.
A driver has deleted it's device object during a surprise remove IRP. 
A driver has marked an IRP pending but didn't return STATUS_PENDING.  
A driver is attempting to delete a device object that has already been\ndeleted via a prior call to IoDeleteDevice.   
The UI Number field of the query capabilities structure in a query\ncapabilities IRP was not properly initialized to -1.    
A driver has returned STATUS_PENDING but did not mark the IRP pending\nvia a call to IoMarkIrpPending.    
The size field of the query capabilities structure in a query\ncapabilities IRP was not properly initialized.   
The address field of the query capabilities structure in a query\ncapabilities IRP was not properly initialized to -1.
Caller has completed untouched IRP_MJ_PNP (instead of passing the irp\ndown) or non-PDO has failed the irp using incorrect value of\nSTATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED.
The version field of the query capabilities structure in a query\ncapabilities IRP was not properly initialized.
Caller has completed a IRP_MJ_PNP it didn't understand instead of\npassing it down.     
Caller has completed successful IRP_MJ_PNP instead of passing it down.
PDO has not responded to a required IRP.
PDO has forgotten to fill out the device relation list with the PDO for\nthe TargetDeviceRelation query.  
IRP completion routines must be in nonpagable code, and this one is not.    
A driver's completion routine has not marked the IRP\npending if the PendingReturned field was set in the IRP passed to it.\nThis may cause the OS to hang, especially if an error is returned by the\n stack.  
An IRP dispatch handler has returned a status that is incorrect\n(0xFFFFFFFF). This is probably due to an uninitialized stack variable. 
An IRP dispatch handler has returned without passing down or completing\nthis Irp or someone forgot to return STATUS_PENDING.     
An IRP dispatch handler for a bus filter has deleted it's device object,\nbut the PDO is still present! Bus filters must clean up in FastIoDetach\ncallbacks.   
An IRP dispatch handler has returned a status that is\ninconsistent with the Irp's IoStatus.Status field. 
IRP_MJ_SYSTEM_CONTROL has been completed by someone other than the\nProviderId. This IRP should either have been completed earlier or\nshould have been passed down.  
An IRP dispatch handler for a PDO has deleted it's device object, but\nthe hardware has not been reported as missing in a bus relations query.\n    
An IRP dispatch handler has not properly detached from the stack below\nit upon receiving a remove IRP.   
This driver has not filled out a dispatch routine for a required IRP\nmajor function.   
Non-successful non-STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED IRP status for IRP_MJ_POWER is\nbeing passed down stack. Failed POWER IRPs must be completed.   
Previously set IRP_MJ_POWER status has been converted to\nSTATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED. This failure status is reserved for use of the OS\n- drivers cannot fail a Power IRP with this value.   
The driver has not handled a required IRP. The driver must update the\nstatus of the IRP to indicate whether it's been handled or not.  
The driver has responded to an IRP that is that is reserved for other\ndevice objects elsewhere in the stack.   
Non-successful non-STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED IRP status for IRP_MJ_PNP is\nbeing passed down stack. Failed PNP IRPs must be completed. 
Previously set IRP_MJ_PNP status has been converted to\nSTATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED. This failure status is reserved for use of the OS\n- drivers cannot fail a PnP IRP with this value. 
Caller has changed the status field of an IRP it does not understand. 
Caller has changed the information field of an IRP it does not understand.  
Caller has forwarded an Irp while skipping a device object in the stack.\nThe caller is probably sending IRPs to the PDO instead of to the device\nreturned by IoAttachDeviceToDeviceStack.   
Caller has trashed or has not properly copied IRP's stack.
Any Power IRP must have status initialized to STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED.   
Any WMI IRP must have status initialized to STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED.     
Caller of IoInitializeIrp has passed an IRP that was allocated with\nIoAllocateIrp. This is incorrect and unneccessary, and has caused a quota\nleak. Check the documentation for IoReuseIrp if this IRP is being\nrecycled.
Any PNP IRP must have status initialized to STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED.     
Caller of IoFreeIrp is freeing an IRP that is still in use!     
Caller of IoFreeIrp is freeing an IRP that is still queued to a\nthread!    
This IRP is about to run out of stack locations. Someone may have\nforwarded this IRP from another stack. 
Caller is completing an IRP that is currently queued beneath it! The\ncode handling IRPs returning STATUS_PENDING in this driver appears to be\nbroken.   
Caller is forwarding an IRP that is currently queued beneath it! The\ncode handling IRPs returning STATUS_PENDING in this driver appears to\nbe broken.   
Caller has manually copied the stack and has inadvertantly copied the\nupper layer's completion routine. Please use\nIoCopyCurrentIrpStackLocationToNext.

The caller provided the IRP Status Information field with a value that\nis greater than the output section of the system buffer.     
A driver has passed an invalid device object to a function that requires\na PDO.     
Driver has returned a suspicious status. This is probably due to an\nuninitialized variable bug in the driver.     
A driver has succeeded IRP_MJ_PNP.IRP_MN_QUERY_DEVICE_RELATIONS(TargetRelations)\nbut didn't properly fill out the request or forward the IRP to the\nunderlying hardware stack.     
A driver has marked an IRP pending but didn't return STATUS_PENDING.     
PDO has forgotten to fill out the device relation list with the PDO for\nthe TargetDeviceRelation query.     
A driver's completion routine has not marked the IRP\npending if the PendingReturned field was set in the IRP passed to it.\nThis may cause the OS to hang, especially if an error is returned by the\n stack.     
IRP_MJ_SYSTEM_CONTROL has been completed by someone other than the\nProviderId. This IRP should either have been completed earlier or\nshould have been passed down.     
The driver has not handled a required IRP. The driver must update the\nstatus of the IRP to indicate whether it's been handled or not.     
Caller has changed the information field of an IRP it does not understand.
